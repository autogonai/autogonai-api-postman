On Postman, the button is at the top left: \n\t<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/autogonai/autogonai-api-postman/raw/main/assets/1.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Postman with 'Import' button out at top left.\"></p>\n\n- On the `Import` pop-up page, select the `Folder` tab. Click the `Choose folder from your computer` button and choose the root folder of the previously cloned repository. \n\n\t<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/autogonai/autogonai-api-postman/raw/main/assets/1.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Postman, showing the Import screen.\"></p>\n\n- Select which collections and environments you would like to import and click the `Import` button.\n\n\t<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/autogonai/autogonai-api-postman/raw/main/assets/1.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Postman showing the Import screen after selecting the folder.\"></p>\n\n- Select the `Environments` tab on the left, choose the environment, and set your API key by changing the `Current Value` column (see screenshot); (The `Timestamp`, `Signature`, `Initial Value` fields can be left empty as they'll be automatically filled by Postman when sending a request.)\n\t<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/autogonai/autogonai-api-postman/raw/main/assets/1.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Postman with showing where the user should fill in their API key.\"></p>\n\n- Select your newly-added environment from the environment dropdown menu. This is at the top right, to the left of the eye icon.\n\t<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/autogonai/autogonai-api-postman/raw/main/assets/1.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Postman showing how imported environments can be selected from a dropdown.\"></p>\n\n\n## Postman safety practices\nThe following practices are advised to secure your account's safety:\n- Don't use Collections obtained from an unknown source.\n- Review the environment JSON file before its usage.\n- Don't use any code that you don't understand.\n- When you finish trying out the API, delete your API keys.\n\n\n## FAQ\n**Q:** Why can't I get any response? \n\nYou haven't imported the environment file or you've imported it but you haven't selected it from the dropdown menu (mentioned in [How to import and configure](#how-to-import-and-configure))\n\n**Q**: Error `API-key format invalid.`\n\nLikely causes:\n- API key is not set.\n- API key is not correct. \n- `X-AUG-KEY` is not selected in your Postman `Headers` tab.\n\n**Q**: Error `Mandatory parameter 'xxxx' was not sent, was empty/null or malformed.`\n\nPlease refer to the API documentation to double check all the mandatory parameters.\n\n\n## My question isn't here\nIf you don't find your answer here, please consult our developer community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/bR8Zzrjw6y) for similar questions from the community or open an issue [here](https://github.com/autogonai/autogonai-api-postman/issues)",
